# High-Performance JSON Serialization Libraries
# Install for optimal compression performance

# Primary recommendation: orjson (2-5x faster than standard json)
orjson>=3.9.0

# Secondary recommendation: ujson (1.5-3x faster than standard json)
ujson>=5.8.0

# Memory profiling and system monitoring
psutil>=5.9.0

# Required for advanced performance analysis
numpy>=1.24.0

# Optional: For even better compression with binary formats
# msgpack>=1.0.0

# Installation instructions:
# pip install -r requirements_performance.txt
#
# Performance impact:
# - orjson: 2-5x faster JSON serialization, lower memory usage
# - ujson: 1.5-3x faster than standard json, good compatibility
# - psutil: Accurate memory monitoring for benchmarking
# - numpy: Vectorized operations for redundancy analysis
#
# Expected improvements:
# - JSON serialization: 70-80% time reduction with orjson
# - Memory usage: 20-30% reduction through better algorithms
# - Overall compression: 50-70% size reduction through redundancy elimination
