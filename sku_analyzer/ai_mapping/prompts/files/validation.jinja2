**VALIDATION TASK**

**Original Mapping Result:**
```json
{{ mapping_result | tojson(indent=2) }}
```

**VALIDATION CRITERIA:**
1. **Accuracy Check:** Are mapped values logically correct for target fields?
2. **Constraint Compliance:** Do mapped values respect field constraints?
3. **Type Safety:** Are data types properly preserved/converted?
4. **Completeness:** Are critical mandatory fields appropriately handled?
5. **Confidence Validation:** Are confidence scores realistic and justified?

**VALIDATION QUESTIONS:**
- Does each mapping make logical sense given the source data?
- Are confidence scores aligned with mapping quality?
- Are unmapped fields truly unmappable from available data?
- Do mapped values respect target field constraints?

**REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:**
```json
{
  "validation_passed": true|false,
  "confidence_adjustment": 0.05,
  "issues_found": [
    {
      "field": "field_name",
      "issue": "description of problem",
      "severity": "low|medium|high",
      "suggestion": "how to fix"
    }
  ],
  "validation_summary": "Overall assessment and recommendations"
