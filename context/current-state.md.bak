# Current Project State

## Project Overview
- **Phase**: Multi-agent system initialization with global agents
- **Focus**: Professional-grade web development and data processing
- **Standards**: Security-first, performance-optimized, accessible design

## Active Work
- **Who**: System ready for task assignment
- **What**: Professional agent coordination system configured with global agents
- **Files**: No active file locks
- **Status**: ✅ Ready for requirements analysis or direct task assignment

## Available Global Professional Agents
Use `claude @{agent-name}` to invoke:
✅ @requirements-analyst - Requirements discovery and specification
✅ @system-architect - Scalable architecture design
✅ @backend-architect - Reliable APIs, databases, security
✅ @frontend-architect - Accessible UI, performance optimization  
✅ @python-expert - Production-quality Python implementation
✅ @security-engineer - Security assessment and compliance
✅ @performance-engineer - Performance analysis and optimization
✅ @quality-engineer - Testing strategies and QA processes
✅ @refactoring-expert - Code quality and technical debt management
✅ @root-cause-analyst - Problem investigation and debugging
✅ @technical-writer - Documentation and technical communication

## Work Completed Today
- Multi-agent coordination system configured for global agents
- Context management initialized
- Professional agent pool ready for deployment

## Ready for Handoff
- None (awaiting first task assignment)

## Blocked/Waiting
- None

## Next Actions Recommended
1. Start with @requirements-analyst for new features
2. Use @system-architect for architecture planning  
3. Route implementation to appropriate specialist agents
4. Always include quality pipeline for production code
